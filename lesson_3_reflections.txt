When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

     Keeping projects local presents the problems faced with collaboration that were 
     mentioned at the beginning of this course; sharing a concurrent, multi-file project
     is unwieldy at best. Remote repositories eanble project team members to push their 
     branches to a central hub where all members can see the changes and retrieve the 
     latest file with ease. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. Whe would you use one 
instead of another?

	You can clone a fork, where forks are used to build upon other's work and cloning is 
	used to build on a project off a git repository. Branches operate on themselves and 
	are useful for creating new features. Cloning and forking are both useful for 
	collaboration, but cloning from a private branch may retain a secure project whereas
	forking may not be ideal for proprietary collaboration (just a WAG). In any case, 
	forking to build upon an abandoned project or a base project that will deliminate 
	from the author's original intent may be desireable as well.
