When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

     Keeping projects local presents the problems faced with collaboration that were 
     mentioned at the beginning of this course; sharing a concurrent, multi-file project
     is unwieldy at best. Remote repositories eanble project team members to push their 
     branches to a central hub where all members can see the changes and retrieve the 
     latest file with ease.
