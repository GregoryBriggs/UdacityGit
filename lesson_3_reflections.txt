When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

     Keeping projects local presents the problems faced with collaboration that were 
     mentioned at the beginning of this course; sharing a concurrent, multi-file project
     is unwieldy at best. Remote repositories eanble project team members to push their 
     branches to a central hub where all members can see the changes and retrieve the 
     latest file with ease. 

  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  
       If you are making changes to a portion of a project, having it run off the last stable build may eliminate the need to constantly
       review code that had been pushed to the master and update the cod-in-progress before one's component is finished.
